# This is a list of experiments that can be used to probe gravity properties or the properties of the universe.


## General Relativity/Gravitation

### Eotvos Torsion Balance

Detection of $R^k_{0l0}=(1/c^2)\partial^2\Phi/\partial x^k\partial x^l \sim 10^{-32} \text{cm}^{-2}$.


### Hughes-Drevershiy Experiment, etc

Anisotropy of gravitation/electromagnetism is not proved in our galaxy.
